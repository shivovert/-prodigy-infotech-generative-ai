# 🧠 Prodigy Infotech - Generative AI Internship (July–August 2025)

Welcome to my project repository for the **Generative AI Internship** at **Prodigy Infotech**. This internship provided hands-on experience in building and experimenting with cutting-edge generative models and AI techniques.

## 📁 Internship Tasks

Each task is organized in its own folder with relevant code, documentation, and outputs.

### ✅ Completed Tasks:

1. **Text Generation using GPT-2**

   * Fine-tuned GPT-2 for generating context-aware text.

2. **Image Generation using Pre-trained Models**

   * Used models like VQGAN+CLIP for generating creative visuals from text prompts.

3. **Text Generation using Markov Chains**

   * Built a simple statistical text generator using character/word-level Markov models.

4. **Image-to-Image Translation using cGAN**

   * Implemented conditional GANs to perform tasks like edge-to-image translation.

5. **Neural Style Transfer**

   * Transferred artistic styles to content images using CNN-based style transfer.
